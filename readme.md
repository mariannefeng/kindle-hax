- uhhh because this is cron if I restart will I not be able to ssh onto the server again if the kindle crashes and restarts or something???? DEFINITELY CHANGE TO A SCRIPT THAT I CAN RUN MANUALLY
- an easy way to "end" the script and return the kindle to normal mode
- how come unplugging the kindle automatically makes it so that it suddenly won't reload anymore (FUCK ME it disables the fucking wifi when unplugged??)
- make it so that the bus times can be seen vertically on the kindle
- fix weird scrollbar behavior for results longer than the page
- think a bit more about interaction between image generation (every 3 mins) w/ kindle cron reload (every minute). What's most efficient and accurate?
- add weather information to the screen
- display some kind of basic kindle info on the screen to be helpful?? (battery life + current time would be huge)
- a mobile friendly UI should exist at kindle.mariannefeng.com that looks good and can be bookmarked/used easily
- kual launcher???
